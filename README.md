# COMP2113-Course-Code

## Description
This GitHub Repository is set up to store the course code of COMP2113 - Programming Technologies at The University of Hong Kong . This course covers 

1. Linux BashShell 
2. Basic in C++
3. Using makefile to compile the C++ code 
4. Basic in C 

There are 2 main motivations for me setting to set up this repository 

1. To back up my code for COMP2113 course work
2. To serve as a question bank for people to learn by coding

Detailed description of the purpose of the code will be explained in the corresponding pdf file.

## How to Install and Run the Project

For the compiling and running C and C++ code, I am just using Microsoft Visual Studio Code.(attach the link https://code.visualstudio.com/)

For running Bash script and using the Linux environment in Window computer, you can use Window Linux Sub-shell (WSL) (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or set up a virtual machine (e.g. Oracle) (https://www.virtualbox.org/) in your computer.
